# Bouncy-Wings
Just another Flappy Bird knockoff.

# Controls:
There is just only one control and that is the <Space>.
Tap <Space> to bounce the box. Keep pressing <Space> to bouce higher.
When you hit an obstacle you will be alerted with the score.

# P.S: The Score alert is annoying I know & I'm trying to fix it.
